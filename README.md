**FAQ Web Page with Expand/Collapse Functionality**  
This project is a simple, interactive Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) web page built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**. Users can click on a question to smoothly expand and view its answer, and click again to collapse it. Only one answer is visible at a time â€” when a new question is clicked, any previously open answer automatically closes. The project uses external CSS and JavaScript files for better structure, styling, and dynamic behavior.
